               With our immediate surroundings being just as 
               replaceable and consumable as the clothes we wear, how would we adjust if these surroundings became entwined with organic matter? Would we care for the item much as we do our favourite houseplants and would this help foster a deeper bond between owner and item? Exploring how this connection can grow through an intersection of biomaterials, physical computing, interactive sound and product design. 
               The culmination of the year spent on the Creative Coding Institure Diploma.
